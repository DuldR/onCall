# oVice Coding HW

## Requirements

 * Ruby 2.7.4
 * Rails 6.0 or greater
 * Yarn 1.22.04

## Running

The easiest way to run the app is to simply view it to Heroku.

Current deployment can be found at: https://pure-reaches-75610.herokuapp.com/#/

To run locally: 

`git clone https://github.com/DuldR/onCall.git`

`cd onCall/`

Next, run the following commands to install the yarn and ruby dependencies:

`gem install bundler`

`bundle install`

`yarn`

`bundle exec rails s`

After running `bundle exec rails s`, the app should be running on [port 3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Testing

Currently, there are no front end tests.
To run the rails tests for models and controllers run `bundle exec rspec`


## Usage

At the main page you'll see a left dashboard and a main viewer:

Clicking on a user on the left portion will open up the shifts that are taken up for October and will show that users requests if there any.

After clicking a user, you can then make a request to swap your shift in the bottom right. Your shift is shown in the left drop down with possible swaps in the right. After making your selection, click submit.

After clicking submit, the user must approve the swap request. That request will be found on that users main page.

If approved, the request will update and the shifts for October will be updated after refresh.

## Future Improvements

Given more time, I would like to make the following improvements:

Front end tests. I'm not too familiar with Jest, but that is something I'd like to implement.
A lot of code could be DRYed up. Especially in the react selectors, test cases and general react logic.
Index nor request refreshs on swap submission or approval. Will need to add logic to refresh on update.
Front end could made to look a little better, especially in ease of usage.
Implement more than one month. Code is ready on the backend, but needs a good front end to hook into.
