## Requirements

 * Ruby 2.7.4
 * Rails 6.0 or greater
 * Yarn 1.22.04

## Running

The easiest way to run the app is to simply view it to Heroku.

Current deployment can be found at: https://pure-reaches-75610.herokuapp.com/#/

To run locally: 

`git clone https://github.com/DuldR/onCall.git`

`cd onCall/`

Next, run the following commands to install the yarn and ruby dependencies:

`gem install bundler`
`bundle install`
`yarn`
`bundle exec rails s`

After running `bundle exec rails s`, the app should be running on [port 3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Testing

Currently, there are no front end tests.
To run the rails tests for models and controllers run `bundle exec rspec`
